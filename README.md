## This is my Project that i applied for Computer Graphics subject.
## i used CMake as a build system in VSCode .
## this game implemented using C++ and OpenGL , FreeGLUT  libraries.
## The idea of the game is that there is a Shooter that shoots at moving targets using the mouse,and there is a specific score that if you skip it, you will lose the game.
